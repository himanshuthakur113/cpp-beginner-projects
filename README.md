# üìù Todo List Application (C++ / OOP)
I have created a basic project using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I want to become a software developer, and I like C++ because of its speed ‚Äî that's why I chose it for this project. I built a Todo List application to apply what I've learned and improve my skills.

While working on this project, I used several OOP concepts:

    Encapsulation: I understood how data can be protected from the end user by combining it into a single, independent unit (a class).

    Abstraction: I focused on hiding the internal logic behind clean, simple interfaces.

I also learned about modularity ‚Äî I structured the program into separate modules like include/ and src/ for better organization. The code is robust and includes basic error handling.

In the future, I want to make this application even more robust, fast, and simple, and eventually turn it into something that helps people and makes their tasks easier to manage.

The project is straightforward: you can add, view, or delete tasks. Each task is treated as an independent object and includes a deadline date.
